The repository consist of AlScN material related journals and a parameter file which can be used for TCAD simulation but yet to be refined further for proper results and the papers used for developing the parameter file is attached in the repository 
Additionally an IEEE paper structure named TCAD_Model.pdf consist of a HEMT structure with ferroelectric material AlScN and  gate dielectric Al2O3 and the corresponding structure editor code and sdevice code is also attached (These codes need to be refined further based on the updates for the material AlScNin future )
